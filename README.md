# Monocles-and-Misers
A text based game revolving around the idea of building and developing settlements

I created this game as a way to practice implementing the union-find and symbol table data structures in c.

Currently there are a lot of limitations on array sizes, but I plan on implementing dynamic resizing at a later date.
